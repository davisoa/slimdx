Notes for our next release (March 2009):

* Samples.sln solution doesn't load in Express editions (solution folders aren't supported)
* Check for compatibility with the .NET 3.5 Client Profile
* NGen the SlimDX DLL on installation of the runtime / SDK.
* Incorporate SlimDX.Windows7.dll into the distribution.
* Look into ClickOnce support.
