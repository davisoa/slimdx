Steps to create a SlimDX release:

Wait for Washu to harass MikeP into fixing everyone's bugs
Wait for MikeP to to fix all my bugs
Start running the MsdnLinkScanner so that I look productive
Avoid doing anything for a while
SVN Update all
Update all version info (MikeP has already done this by now) -- INCLUDING THE LINKER SETTINGS
Full rebuild of SlimDX Public x86, x64
(manifest/resign steps have been folded into the build configuration)
Update everything related to versions etc in the docs (also handled by MikeP by now)
Build Public-Win32 of SlimDXDocs.sln -- automatically combines the XML file generated by MsdnLinkScanner

Update install\ExtraFiles\DXRedist for the latest:
  The set of five files in this folder must always be updated from the SDK.
  The CAB files have to be replaced with their latest version. What CABS varies wildly between SDKs.
  Make sure install\ExtraFiles\VCRedist is in sync with whatever compiler we're using.
  

That means SlimDX.dll/pdb/xml for both platforms, and fresh docs.
In SlimDXInstall.sln:
Redist.wxs:
  Update version defines at the top of the file
  Change the Product GUID (set this for ClickOnce product.xml as well)
  Update the DXRedist component for the correct CABs that haven't been updated this release. Luckily each filename is duplicated a couple times. Thanks WiX!
  Compile SlimDXRedist to make sure you've got those paths correct.
  There will be a huge list of warnings. They can be ignored.
  
Now install it. Seriously. Can't test the samples without it.

Time to build the publish folder. I've added it to SVN, mostly, so just update all the files that are there.
Then it's time to set up the samples.
  Change all SlimDX project references in the samples to GAC references.
    The correct SlimDX reference string is:
      <Reference Include="SlimDX, Version=2.0.X.Y, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b1b0c32fd1ffe4f9" />
    The entry to replace is:
      <ProjectReference Include="..\..\..\build\SlimDX.vcproj">
  Do a full rebuild of samples solution.
  Make the Samples_Express.sln, by magic.
    Change line 3 of the sln to: # Visual C# Express 2008
  Copy the samples to their staging location under publish
  Strip out everything but the source and final binaries. That means:
    .svn directories
    bin/obj directories
    .suo, .user, potentially .ncb
  7-zip up the directory as a 7z SFX archive. The resulting file should be called "SlimDX Samples.exe".

  
  Now go do that exact same stuff from Redist.wxs, to SlimDX.wxs, but remember to drop the Condition on the DXRedist_x64 component.
  
  That should be everything!
