General
	* Added DebugName properties to appropriate D3D9, 10, 11, and DXGI objects. This property allows a friendly name to be attached to the object, 
		which can be used in debug messages and in the PIX object table.

Samples
	* Fixed the MiniTri10 sample to not use the console subsystem.
	* Changed the sample framework to check for fullscreen DXGI swap chain before disposing.
	* Removed unused testing code from SimpleModel10.
	* Fixed configuration issues in MiniTri11.
	* Fixed Device.Clear depth value in WPF control.

Math
	* Added an overload of Ray.Intersects that returns the barycentric hit coordinates.
	* Moved the Direct2D Matrix3x2 type into the main math library.
	* Added several helper methods to the Matrix3x2 type.
	* Fixed a bug in the Matrix.Billboard methods.

Direct2D
	* Added constructors for Bitmap that allow construction via DXGI shared surfaces.

Direct3D 9
	* Fixed a memory in Utilities.ReadRange that affected many BaseMesh methods.
	* Fixed a typo in the caps structure that filled VolumeTextureFilterCaps with the wrong value.
	* Fixed memory issue in Include interface.
	* Changed AnimationOutput to be a reference type, and pinned the memory to receive animation updates.
	* Added an overload to AnimationController.RegisterAnimationOutput to take a Frame instead.
	* Fixed overload defaults for texture creation functions when using D3D9Ex.
	* Changed BaseMesh index buffer and vertex buffer to be ancillary objects. They no longer require explicit cleanup.
	
Direct3D 10
	* Added missing creation method overloads to Effect.
	* Added missing Get/SetRawValue methods to EffectVariable.
	* Added GetInputLayout to the InputAssember device stage.
	* Added GetPrimitiveTopology to the InputAssember device stage.
	* Added GetIndexBuffer to the InputAssember device stage.
	* Added GetVertexBuffers to the InputAssember device stage.
	* Added ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible and ResourceOptionFlags.KeyedMutex.
	* Added Resource.SaveTextureToFile, which allows for saving a texture without knowing its concrete type.
	* Fixed a COM reference leak in Device.OpenSharedResource.

Direct3D 11
	* Fixed a COM reference leak in Device.OpenSharedResource.
	* Added IsDataAvailable to the DeviceContext interface.
	* Added Resource.SaveTextureToFile, which allows for saving a texture without knowing its concrete type.

DXGI
	* Changed SwapChain.Dispose to throw if the adapter is in fullscreen mode. This prevents a crash inside DXGI.
	* Added IsFullScreen property to SwapChain as a convenient alternative to GetFullScreenState.
	* Fixed a null reference check in Output.GetClosestMatchingMode.
	* Added Surface1 support.
	
D3DCompiler
	* Fixed memory issue in Include interface.
	* Added overloads to ShaderBytecode.Compile to take source name for error reporting purposes.
	
DirectWrite
	* Changed TextLayout to inherit from TextFormat.
	
DirectInput
	* Fixed a typo in Device.GetObjectInfoById that caused it to return info by usage instead.
	* Changed ObjectProperties.LogicalRange and ObjectProperties.PhysicalRange to return actual ranges instead of integers.
	
XAPO
	* Fixed the flow of calls to the XAPO interfaces and their implementations.
	* Fixed a memory bug in the XAPO base class constructors.

Windows
	* Added functionality to the RenderForm class to add sizing and monitor change events.

Samples
	* Added BasicComputeShader sample for D3D11.
