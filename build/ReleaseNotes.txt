Samples
	* Fixed the MiniTri10 sample to not use the console subsystem.
	* Changed the sample framework to check for fullscreen DXGI swap chain before disposing.
	* Removed unused testing code from SimpleModel10.

Direct3D9
	* Fixed a memory in Utilities.ReadRange that affected many BaseMesh methods.
	* Fixed a typo in the caps structure that filled VolumeTextureFilterCaps with the wrong value.

DXGI

DirectWrite
	* Changed TextLayout to inherit from TextFormat.
