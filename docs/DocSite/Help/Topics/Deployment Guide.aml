          Deployment of SlimDX applications can be relatively simple or complex, depending on the sophistication of the application being deployed and the method of deployment.
          This document will cover the exact components required for a SlimDX application to run and how best to handle installation of those components on a client system.

          The most fundamental requirement for any SlimDX based application is Microsoft's .NET Framework.
          SlimDX requires a minimum .NET version of <b>2.0, Service Pack 1</b>.
          Any later version of .NET (up to 3.5 Service Pack 1 at the time of writing) may be substituted successfully.
          Previous versions of SlimDX also required the Visual C++ Runtime, however, since the November 2008 release SlimDX uses the same version that is included with .NET itself.
          (September 2008 required the Visual C++ 2008 runtime, and most versions previous to that required the Visual C++ 2005 SP1 runtime.)
          This is sufficient to load the SlimDX library and begin using some core components, such as the math library and utilities.
        </para>
        <para>
          Most SlimDX based applications will also want to use at least some of DirectX.
          SlimDX is configured to <i>delay load</i> all of its DirectX DLL dependencies.
          This means that none of it is required until an application actually tries to use that component.
          (Note that Direct3DX is forcibly loaded along with Direct3D in the November 2008 release; this may change in future versions.)
          Because SlimDX releases are matched with DirectX SDK releases, the versions of the two match up.
          The November 2008 release of SlimDX is built on the November 2008 release of DirectX, which uses Direct3DX version 40.
          An end user can install the November 2008 DirectX redistributable package, or any later version, and their system will be correctly configured.

      <title>Deployment</title>

          The first component to deploy to a client system is the .NET Framework.
          Because is is a rather large package (around 22 megabytes), and also fairly common, we recommend that you direct your users to the Microsoft website to download and install it themselves.
          This is especially true because the exact version of the Framework required will depend on your application, and may not match the minimum requirement of SlimDX itself.
        </para>
        <para>
          For the remaining DirectX dependencies, developers may choose to direct the user to download the SlimDX End User Redistributable package, or embed it in their own installer.
          This package installs a minimal compressed subset of the DirectX components containing only what is required for SlimDX applications.
          It also registers the signed SlimDX assembly in the Global Assembly Cache as a shared assembly, thus allowing other applications to use it as well.
          If you intend to set up SlimDX as a shared assembly, it is strongly recommended that you use the redistributable package.
          SlimDX versions can be identified in the GAC using the last two pieces of the version number (the first two match the base framework version, currently 2.0).
          The third value is the SlimDX release number, which is 8 in the November 2008 release..
          The last value corresponds to the Direct3DX version number for the SDK used to build SlimDX, which is 40 in the November 2008 release.
        </para>
        <para>
          SlimDX can also be used as a private assembly; developers may choose to use either the publicly released version or a customized build in this case.
          If you do use a customized build, please set it up as a private assembly and do <b>not</b> install it to the Global Assembly Cache.
          We also ask that when using a private build, you change the version number, preferably using a 0 for the major version or changing the format entirely.
          In either case, the SlimDX redistributable package is probably not an appropriate choice.
          You can point users to the correct version of the DirectX redistributable on Microsoft's site, or to the much smaller DirectX web installer also hosted by Microsoft.
          Alternately you can package the redistributable with your own installer, or create a customized minimal redistributable like SlimDX does.
          Note that the Microsoft DirectX web installer is <i>not</i> redistributable and you are required to point users to their website.
