    <introduction>
      <para>
        The public builds of SlimDX that are signed and released by the SlimDX team are configured based on how we expect most developers to use the library.
        However, we cannot possibly account for the needs of everyone, and so it's assumed that it will sometimes be necessary for developers to produce customized builds.
        Some of these builds may be intended to fix bugs that are required for a product before the next SlimDX release.
        Others may add in or strip out custom features, or may use a different DirectX version than the official build.
        This section is intended to provide guidance to developers who need to produce custom builds of SlimDX, for whatever reason.
