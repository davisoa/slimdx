        These components are intended to assist in developing and deploying SlimDX applications.

      <content>
        <para>The SDK is composed of the following top level folders:</para>
        <list class="bullet">
          <listItem>
            <para>
              <database>Bin</database> - Contains the SlimDX assemblies for x86 and x64, along with symbols and XML documentation files.
              These files support Visual Studio's Intellisense and debugging features, as well as providing developers with easy access to the assembly files.
            </para>
          </listItem>
          <listItem>
            <para>
              <database>DirectX Redist</database> - Contains all of the Microsoft DirectX redistributable files that are relevant to this release of SlimDX.
              Developers can use this folder to construct a more compact installation than what the official DirectX or SlimDX packages provide.
              It can also be used as a guide to the components necessary for a given release of SlimDX.
