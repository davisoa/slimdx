    <introduction>
      <para>
        At some point in the lifecycle of a product, it will typically become necessary to build an installer for it.
        This process can become quite complex, depending on the complexity of the application and its dependencies.
        This guide exists to cover all of the information necessary to successfully install a SlimDX based application.

            Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 runtime
            <para>
              The March 2011 version of SlimDX upgraded the runtime requirement to VC++ 2010, which allowed
              us to provide a .NET 4.0 installer.
            </para>

            Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or later
            <para>
              The most fundamental requirement for any SlimDX based application is Microsoft's .NET Framework.
              SlimDX requires a minimum .NET version of <legacyBold>2.0</legacyBold>.
              Additionally, the January 2012 version of SlimDX ships with separate .NET 4.0 binaries, so
              using these will require that the appropriate .NET Framework version is installed as well.
              Note that SlimDX should run properly on the Client Profile configurations of .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0 as well.

            DirectX Components (June 2010)
            <para>
              Most SlimDX based applications will also want to use at least some version of DirectX.
              SlimDX is configured to <newTerm>delay load</newTerm> all of its DirectX DLL dependencies.
              This means that none of it is required until an application actually tries to use that component.
              (Note that Direct3DX is forcibly loaded along with Direct3D in the January 2012 release; this may change in future versions.)

              SlimDX releases are usually matched with DirectX SDK release, although this is not the case
              for the January 2012 release. SlimDX January 2012 relies on the older June 2010 release of the DirectX SDK, which uses Direct3DX version 43.
              An end user can install the June 2010 DirectX redistributable package, or any later version, and their system will be correctly configured.

      <title>The Deployment Process</title>

      <content>
        <para>
          The first component to deploy to a client system is the .NET Framework.
          Because is is a rather large package (around 22 megabytes), and also fairly common, we recommend that you direct your users to the Microsoft website to download and install it themselves.
          This is especially true because the exact version of the Framework required will depend on your application, and may not match the minimum requirement of SlimDX itself.
        </para>
        <para>
          For the remaining DirectX dependencies, developers may choose to direct the user to download the SlimDX End User Redistributable package, or embed it in their own installer.
          This package installs a minimal compressed subset of the DirectX components containing only what is required for SlimDX applications.
          It also registers the signed SlimDX assembly in the Global Assembly Cache as a shared assembly, thus allowing other applications to use it as well.
          If you intend to set up SlimDX as a shared assembly, it is strongly recommended that you use the redistributable package.
        </para>
        <para>
          SlimDX versions can be identified in the GAC using the last two pieces of the version number (the first two match the base framework version, currently 2.0 and 4.0).
          The third value is the SlimDX release number, which is 13 in the January 2012 release.
          The last value corresponds to the Direct3DX version number for the SDK used to build SlimDX, which is 43 in the January 2012 release.
          Note that the source code for the redistributable is a WiX script and accompanying Visual Studio project, which is included in the SDK and may be customized if desired.
          Please read <link xlink:href="a2beac1b-ae9d-4695-8520-5731221e8f60">Integrating the Runtime</link> and <link xlink:href="ce55d4f2-33c3-4677-8ad4-e2ac0a56fa2e">Customizing the Runtime</link> for more information.
        </para>
        <para>
          SlimDX can also be used as a private assembly; developers may choose to use either the publicly released version or a customized build in this case.
          If you do use a customized build, please set it up as a private assembly and do <legacyBold>not</legacyBold> install it to the Global Assembly Cache.
          We also ask that when using a private build, you change the version number, preferably using a 0 for the major version or changing the format entirely.
          In either case, the SlimDX redistributable package is probably not an appropriate choice.
          You can point users to the correct version of the DirectX redistributable on Microsoft's site, or to the much smaller DirectX web installer also hosted by Microsoft.
          Alternately you can package the redistributable with your own installer, or create a customized minimal redistributable like SlimDX does.
          Note that the Microsoft DirectX web installer is <legacyBold>not</legacyBold> redistributable and you are required to point users to their website.

      <title>Silent Installation</title>

      <content>
        <para>
          Software installation on Windows based systems is typically driven by Windows Installer, which consists mainly of MSI files and the <command>msiexec</command> command.
          The SlimDX runtime package is an MSI file, and can be run using this command line:
        </para>
        <para>
          <command>msiexec /package "SlimDX Runtime (January 2012).msi"</command>
        </para>
        <para>
          Running <command>msiexec</command> without any parameters brings up a window with more available command line parameters.
          Of particular interest are the <system>/passive</system> and <system>/quiet</system> flags.
          The <system>/passive</system> flag causes an installation dialog to be displayed that shows a progress bar as it runs through installation steps, but does not prompt for any kind of user interaction.
          This switch is useful when you want to communicate progress separately from your own installation process.
          The <system>/quiet</system> flag suppresses all indication that anything is happening.
          No UI is displayed at any point.
          If you choose to use the <system>/quiet</system> flag, we recommend that you show text of your own to inform the user that a process is running.
          The SlimDX Runtime itself does this when it invokes the DirectX runtime installation.

      <title>ClickOnce</title>

      <content>
        <para>
          The SlimDX February 2010 release introduced support for Microsoft's ClickOnce technology. Using it, developers can
          create a quick and easy installation package by simply selecting support for it from within the Publish menu
          inside Visual Studio. This process is relatively easy and straightforward, and so it will not be described in-depth here.
