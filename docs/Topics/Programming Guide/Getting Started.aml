        Getting started with SlimDX is easy, but the steps are not necessarily obvious.
        This guide should help anyone interested to begin developing SlimDX based applications.

          In order to work with SlimDX, you need to have a development environment that allows you to write and run code in a .NET language.
          We recommend
          <externalLink>
            <linkText>Visual C# Express</linkText>
            <linkUri>http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/</linkUri>
          </externalLink>, but any similar tool should work just fine.
          It's also recommended that you download the latest DirectX SDK from the
          <externalLink>
            <linkText>Microsoft DirectX Developer Center</linkText>
            <linkUri>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/default.aspx</linkUri>
          </externalLink>.
          This SDK contains a lot of Microsoft written documentation, as well as sample projects in C++ (which are easily translated to SlimDX code) showcasing many useful tricks and techniques.
          However, this is a very large package, typically in excess of 450 MB, and not required to build SlimDX applications.
          If you prefer, you can simply use online documentation, tutorials, and samples.

      <title>Installing SlimDX</title>

      <content>
        <para>
          Most people will want to use the latest public release of SlimDX, which can always be found on our
          <externalLink>
            <linkText>development home page</linkText>
            <linkUri>http://code.google.com/p/slimdx/</linkUri>
          </externalLink>.
          The package there is a fully built and tested version, including an installer that will automatically ensure that your system has everything necessary to build and run SlimDX based applications.
          New releases happen soon after Microsoft makes a new DirectX release, which currently happens several times a year.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can also download and compile the SlimDX source code yourself.
          This will require a Visual C++ 2010 installation that is correctly set up to compile DirectX applications and is recommended for advanced users only.
          In order to download the source, you will need a Subversion client, such as TortoiseSVN or SmartSVN.
          Once one has been installed, create a new folder on your system where you would like the source downloaded, and perform an SVN Checkout into that directory.
          The exact process will vary depending on what client you have installed.
          For TortoiseSVN, simply right click on the folder and select SVN Checkout from the menu.
          The repository URL is http://slimdx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/.
          The client will then download the complete source code tree of SlimDX.

      <title>Writing Applications</title>

        <para>
          There are a number of samples available for SlimDX that showcase the library and how to use it effectively.
          A good starting point is the SimpleTriangle sample for Direct3D9, which is built on our SlimDX SampleFramework.
          The SampleFramework source code is under the MIT license, so you should feel free to use as little or as much of it as you like.
          If you prefer a more stripped down example, the MiniTri sample does the same thing in a single hundred line file.
          There are similar minimal samples for most of the other supported APIs as well.
        </para>

        <para>
          Apart from the SlimDX samples, there are hundreds of samples written by companies and individuals in C++, Managed DirectX, or XNA that demonstrate all kinds of useful things.
          Although these cannot be copied verbatim to work with SlimDX, the code is typically very similar and we encourage people to use techniques learned from these samples with SlimDX.
          The differences are generally quite minor, and so they can be a great additional resource for SlimDX developers.
