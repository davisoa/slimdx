			We are now accepting PayPal donations!
			SlimDX is over 150,000 lines of code, and that takes real time and effort to build outside of our normal lives.
			By donating, you help to support us, support the project, and ensure that the library continues to thrive.
			We don't request any specific minimum or maximum values for donations; all contributions are appreciated!
			If you would prefer to mail a check, please e-mail <tt>promit ~dot~ roy ~at~ gmail.com</tt> directly to get an address.
