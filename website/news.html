            <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
            <p>The November SDK does not add much to the SlimDX core library in terms of new features. There are some bug fixes, all of which are listed in the Release Notes, as well as in the SDK documentation. The focus of this release was on making development and deployment of SlimDX applications much smoother, since this is an area where we've been getting a lot of feedback for improvements.<br /><br />
Amongst those features is a proper end user runtime, which quickly and quietly installs everything needed on a system to run SlimDX programs. This installer supports silent installation and does not create a Program Files entry. It is unified for 32 bit and 64 bit systems, and the SDK includes the full WiX script used to create it so that developers may customize it or use it as a model.<br /><br />
We have also evolved our documentation beyond a simple class reference, and it now includes a number of topics discussing development. There are relatively few of these articles right now, but in the future this part of the documentation will continue to expand.</p>
