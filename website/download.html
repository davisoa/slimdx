                <h2>End User Runtime</h2>
                <p>This is the package for end users. It works on both 32 and 64 bit systems, for all versions of Windows supported by the .NET Framework. If you're just trying to run a SlimDX program that someone else gave you, this is the installer you want to download. Developers should point users to this link, or include it with their own installers. See the documentation for more information.</p><br />

                <h2>Remarks</h2>
                <p>The November SDK does not add much to the SlimDX core library in terms of new features. There are some bug fixes, all of which are listed in the Release Notes, as well as in the SDK documentation. The focus of this release was on making development and deployment of SlimDX applications much smoother, since this is an area where we've been getting a lot of feedback for improvements.<br /><br />
    Amongst those features is a proper end user runtime, which quickly and quietly installs everything needed on a system to run SlimDX programs. This installer supports silent installation and does not create a Program Files entry. It is unified for 32 bit and 64 bit systems, and the SDK includes the full WiX script used to create it so that developers may customize it or use it as a model.<br /><br />
    We have also evolved our documentation beyond a simple class reference, and it now includes a number of topics discussing development. There are relatively few of these articles right now, but in the future this part of the documentation will continue to expand.</p>

                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>There are several different ways to get in touch with the SlimDX team:
        
        We suggest that questions be posted to the DirectX forum on GameDev.Net, as all of the SlimDX developers are regulars there. You may at your discretion prefix your thread title with SlimDX.
        If you believe you have found a bug, or you have a feature request, please enter it on this site under the Issues tab.
        The developers are also typically available in the #gamedev and #graphicsdev IRC channels on AfterNET (irc.afternet.org).
        You can email the developer list, slimdx-devel@googlegroups.com. This is not a recommended method of communicating with us, but may be used as a last ditch effort.
        If you're interested in working on SlimDX itself, we would be glad to have the help. Send a private message to Promit on the GameDev.Net forums or email slimdx-devel@googlegroups.com if you want to contribute.</p>
