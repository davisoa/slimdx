        <h1>What is SlimDX?</h1>
        <p>SlimDX is a library originally prototyped by Promit Roy which allows .NET 2.0 applications (including C#, VB.NET, IronPython, F#, and more) to use Microsoft's DirectX APIs, as well as several related Microsoft APIs that share similar goals. This role was previously filled for .NET 1.1 applications by Microsoft's own Managed DirectX (MDX) library. However, the age of .NET 1.1, plus Microsoft's lack of interest in continuing MDX has made it necessary to build a new library. Thanks to enthusiastic community support and the invaluable contributions of several other developers who have worked on and with SlimDX, the library has made immense strides towards being a fully viable platform on which to build DirectX based applications. SlimDX is no longer a beta and is considered stable!<br /><br />
        
All development is based in our <a href="#">Google Code homepage</a>. You can use that site to report bugs (using our issues page), as well as download binary releases or a complete copy of the source code. If you have questions to ask, or otherwise wish to discuss SlimDX, we ask that you use the DirectX forum on GameDev.Net. This is the only forum on which the developers are active; we do not use any other forums or mailing lists. Please prefix your thread subject with [SlimDX] if the question is reasonably specific to SlimDX. If it isn't, feel free to include or exclude the prefix as you like. Lastly, you can try and get a hold of us on IRC, in the #graphicsdev channel on irc.afternet.org. The discussion pages in this Wiki should only be used for discussion of the documentation, rather than SlimDX itself.</p><br />

        <h2>Why not use XNA Game Studio?</h2>
        <p class="homep">XNA Game Studio (XNA GS) is Microsoft's new initiative for game development in .NET applications. It is mostly source compatible between both Windows and Xbox 360 platforms. Note that "XNA" is used as shorthand for the XNA Framework.
XNA is first and foremost an Xbox API. This is an unavoidable consequence of the decision to make applications using XNA source compatible across both Windows and the Xbox. Naturally, the console is the more limiting of the two in its capabilities, and those limitations are carried over into XNA and affect all XNA based applications.
XNA GS only supports C#, and not any other language. (XNA Framework does support any .NET language, but you lose many of the advantages of using XNA if you are only using the framework.)
XNA GS and the XNA Framework do not support 64 bit.
Since XNA does not support libraries that are not compatible with the Xbox, developers are forced to use other libraries if they wish to use other functionality under Windows. For example, there is no low level audio API in XNA, so in order to do low level audio work, you must use Managed DirectX or SlimDX to access DirectSound. There is also no support for controller devices that are not XInput compliant, and most are not. (Only Xbox 360 peripherals are.)
The primary sound library in XNA, called XACT, is not particularly good. It's a half baked port from the Xbox version, and only exists as a stop gap until the XAudio 2 library is ready to use. XAudio 2 will be in beta until March 2008, and will only be integrated into XNA after that. XACT is a high level library that does not support any sort of custom sound codecs. No Speex, no Ogg Vorbis, no MP3. In fact, all it does support under Windows is PCM and ADPCM data. ADPCM only offers a maximum compression ratio of 4:1, which means that a five minute long audio file will typically take around 25 MB of disk space.
XNA does not have any Direct3D 10 support, and it seems unlikely that support will ever be added. (There's even less hope for DirectX 11 and future versions.) As a result, it's impossible to develop cutting edge graphical applications on top of XNA's graphics API. This situation can only get worse, as new versions of Direct3D are released.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, XNA does not support the fixed function pipeline. For games that wish to run on hardware predating shaders (common in the indie market), XNA is unusable.
XNA is difficult (though not impossible) to interface cleanly with a normal Windows interface, which makes authoring tools an akward experience at best.
XNA does not expose its internal pointers, nor does it allow construction of objects from native pointers. This makes it impossible to make XNA interoperate with other libraries such as DirectShow, CUDA, or native C/C++ code.
XNA GS 3.0 is only usable with Visual Studio 2008, and version 2.0 is only compatible with VS 2005. This means that your choice of version and therefore feature set is constrained by what Visual Studio version you are using, and vice versa. It also makes switching between the two uncomfortable at best. (SlimDX can be used by either Visual Studio version, and can be built in either one as well.)</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p class="homep">Getting started with SlimDX is easy to do. First, you will need to have a development environment that allows you to write and run code in a .NET language. We suggest Visual C# Express. Note that this should already be familiar to you; if it isn't, you're probably not ready to work with SlimDX. If this is new to you, consider learning some non-graphics programming. For example, write a text based game such as Tic-Tac-Toe. That will help ensure you understand the basics before getting in over your head.
Now, you can either download the binary or source versions of SlimDX. The source version is updated very frequently, but can only be obtained via a Subversion client. The binary version is updated less frequently, but can be gotten from our Google Code homepage as a simple HTTP download. It's best to get the binary version if you have an Express edition of Visual Studio, or if you just don't want to deal with getting and compiling the source code.
If you do wish to download the source code and build SlimDX yourself, you will need to get a Subversion client. Our recommendation is TortoiseSVN. Once installed, create a new folder on your hard drive where you would like the source downloaded. Right click the folder and select SVN Checkout from the shell menu. Use the following string as the URL (without the quotes): "http://slimdx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/" This will give you the complete source of SlimDX. This is not recommended unless you believe you will need to make changes to SlimDX; use the binary released version if you can.
Next, you'll want to get the latest DirectX SDK download. This download includes all of the Microsoft written documentation and sample projects. However, be aware that this is a large file, typically in excess of 450 MB, and is not strictly required to work with SlimDX. If you prefer, you can simply use online documentation, tutorials, and samples.
For Direct3D work, the SimpleTriangle sample is an excellent starting point. (Or MiniTri if you're really in a hurry.) We also include the more sophisticated Water sample, which showcases some more advanced graphics work using SlimDX. Those are the only samples currently available that are tailored to SlimDX, although we are working to add more. However, we encourage you to look at both Managed DirectX and C++ DirectX samples. These will help you get a feel for how DirectX based applications work, and can be a great source of ideas.
Be sure to read the Conventions page.</p>

        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <p class="homep">SlimDX was first publically revealed on June 30, 2007. It has grown explosively since then, with a number of new developers signing up to develop and test. As of the June 2008 release, it is no longer in beta and is considered stable. The best way to monitor SlimDX's progress is to keep an eye on the <a href="#">Release Notes</a> page.
The following APIs are completely supported by SlimDX:
Direct3D 9,
Direct3D 10,
DXGI,
DirectInput,
XInput,
Raw input,
XAudio 2,
X3DAudio,
DirectSound.</p>
